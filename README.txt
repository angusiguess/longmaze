Suppose you have an n x m grid with a start position S and an end position E. Each square on the grid can be occupied by either an empty space (represented by a '.') or a wall (represented by a '#'). How can we arrange the walls on the grid such that a traversal of empty spaces from S to E would result in the longest possible path?

Input: First, a line containing N and M, with the dimensions of the grid.

Next, a series of lines with ., S, or E, representing space, the start, and the end respectively.

Currently, the output will display each of the longest paths as they are discovered by recursive backtracking.
